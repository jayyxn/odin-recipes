        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>Nilaga, which means<em>"pinakuluan"</em> or boiled, refers to Filipino meat and vegetable soup where chunks of beef, pork,</p>
        <p>or chicken are cooked in seasoned broth until fork-tender. Quartered onions, peppercorns, and fish sauce add flavor to the soup while abundant local </p>
        <p>produce such as potatoes, corn, cabbage, pechay, green (Baguio) beans, and carrots turn it into a hearty one-pot meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 pounds beef shanks, bone-in</li>
            <li>1 pound beef tendon</li>
            <li>8 cups water</li>
            <li>1 large onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>3 corn, husked and cut into halves</li>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 small cabbage, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>12 green beans, end trimmed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>green onions, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, combine beef shanks, beef tendon, and water. Over medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top.</li>
            <li>When clear of froth, add onions, peppercorns, and fish sauce.</li>
            <li>Lower heat, cover and cook at no more than a simmer for about 2 to 2 Â½ hours or until shanks are tender and tendons are soft. Add more water as needed during cooking to maintain about 6 to 7 cups.</li>
            <li>Add corn and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes and cook for about 5 minutes or until almost tender.</li>
            <li>Add green beans and cabbage and cook for another 2 to 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender yet crisp.</li>
            <li>Season with salt to taste. Ladle into serving bowls and garnish with chopped green onions, if desired. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
